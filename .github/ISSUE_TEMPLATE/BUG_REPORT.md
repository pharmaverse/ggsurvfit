If you have found a bug, please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect.

INCLUDE a *minimal* reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>. It'll take minutes to master creating a reprex.
ISSUES WITHOUT A REPRODUCIBLE EXAMPLE WILL LIKELY BE CLOSED WITHOUT A RESPONSE.
