Description: Ease the creation of time-to-event (aka survival) endpoint
    figures with 'ggplot2'.  The concise and modular code creates images
    that are ready for publication or sharing.  Each of the functions that
    add to or modify the existing ggplot are written as proper 'ggplot2'
    geoms or stat methods, allowing the functions from this package to be
    combined with any functions or customization from 'ggplot2' and other
    'ggplot2' extensions.
